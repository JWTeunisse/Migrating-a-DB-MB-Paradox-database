# Migrating-a-DB-MB-Paradox-database
This repository is about a way how to migrate a DB/MB Paradox database. It describes our search to find a way to retrieve memoBlob fields from the MB filetype using the data form a memoBlob field in the DB filetype. Besides the memoBlof field it also deals with other Blob types like a Graphic field.
It started a couple months ago when a dear friend asked for my assistance to help him to retrieve text data from the MB file in a old but still used Paradox database.

In this repository you will find a PDF article with a description of the DB and MB Paradox filetypes. It is based on the work of mr Mitchell's document ‘Paradox 4.x File Formats, Revision 1, May 11, 1996’ and that other document ‘PxFormat.txt’, compiled by Randy Beck (http://www.randybeck.com). You can find Mitchell's document in other Github repositories.

Also is included the source code of a prototype program, coded in Winbatch (a sort of basic/fortran like programming language called WIL).
